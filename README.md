# ProjectThree
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

In this project we were asked to interpret a list of items sold from a store, to see which items were most popular. Knowing which items are best sellers would give the store manager an idea of the best way to lay out the store to increase profits. There a three ways to find items. The first lets you search items by name, the second shows all items and the amounts sold, last option shows the items sold in a histogram format.

What did you do particularly well?

The logic for a program like this is very straightforward forward so I will not be commenting on that. I am particularly proud of the documentation of inline comments. Everything is easy to understand its use.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

For a program like this, I believe the only way to enhance the code would be to add verification to make sure the user entered a valid choice in the menu. Right now if anything besides 1 2 or 3 is selected the program acts as if 4 was selected and the program exits. This would be very annoying to a user who accidentally hit the wrong key.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of the project was using a MAP, I had no prior experience to using maps, but I was very familiar with dictionaries. Once I understood the syntax it became very easy. I used YouTube tutorials explaining maps as well as the documentation on the C++ website.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?

This project helped cement the idea of reading in lines from an outside source and working with that data. Most of the time we will need to be using information coming from an outside source, being able to load it in and manipulate it the way you want is very important.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make this program maintainable I broke it down into small sections. This way if I need to edit a piece I can go to that small section and make the changes, instead of scrolling through a huge code block. It is made readable by using white space and indentation, and it is adaptable through the use of classes.
